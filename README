I cloned MoonWarrious (a sample cocos2dx project @ http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/MoonWarriors_-_Cocos2d-html5_Showcase) tweaked it a little to make it run on my system. Removed several game related files leaving only the screen menu, options and help.

First we will run the project, create the menu screens (with just simple buttons) to get used to the framework and to get used to git.

Let running this project be our first goal.

Instructions to run this project:
    *   Install MAMP / WAMP / LAMP depending on the OS u use. or any other web server you know.
    *   Clone the project from https://github.com/saiy2k/gg-new-html5-game into your WWW root (or just dload the ZIP)
    *   Try running via localhost.
    *   For a newbie, above steps will be very daunting. Contact me anytime (mobile / skype / gmail chat / fb) for assistance.

Once the project is run (u cant play the game, I removed gameplay files), see the files in js/src (study only this folder), starting with SysMenu.js (this the file that shows the menu screen), then move to SettingsLayer.js and AboutLayer.js

Note: This is only a temporary repo, feel free to play with it
